## Usage

The app should have the following features:

- **Menu** - simple dropdown menu with sub-menu features
- **Content Feed** - parts of the body contain scrollable image sections with neat horizontal navigation features
- **Responsive Content** - Some of the buttons and images(and spaces containing them) are responsive to hover and offer different animations

## Project Status

Project is: Semi-Complete (Demo)

## Room for Improvement

- The website is not fully mobile-responsive. Unfortunately adding responsiveness takes more time and would make me miss the initial project deadline. The banner needs the most work with mobile-responsiveness.

- The menu needs more work, especially with the animations!

- Most of the buttons do not have animations as there is currently no page developed for where they would lead to. The entire button layout needs to be changed as well as I used image files for some of the buttons, and need to find their respective hover images. Some of the animations for hovering images were changed to save time.

- Some of the main image files are out of focus and need to be adjusted.

## Acknowledgements

- Many thanks to Array for including me in their Front End Developer assessment project.
